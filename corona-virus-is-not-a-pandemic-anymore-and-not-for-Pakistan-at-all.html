          	As of 11 April,2020, there are <em>1,754,457</em> confirmed cases of Covid-19 with <em>107,520</em> deaths in the world. USA is at the top of the list with most confirmed deaths <em>20,061</em>. Europe is second most affected area of this virus with Italy, Spain, France and UK being most affected after USA. The most appropriate way to fight this pandemic would be to develop an effective vaccine and make it available from upper to lower class of the world. But according to reports it might take at-least a year to develop such vaccine for production. This means that world might be on lockdown for at-least 6-months if not a year as it is now in most countries. Three influenza pandemics occurred at intervals of several decades during the 20th century, the most severe of which was the so-called <em>"Spanish Flu"</em> (caused by an A(H1N1) virus), estimated to have caused <em>20–50 million deaths</em> in <em>1918–1919</em>. Milder pandemics occurred subsequently in 1957–1958 (the <em>"Asian Flu"</em> caused by an A(H2N2) virus) and in 1968 (the <em>"Hong Kong Flu"</em> caused by an A(H3N2) virus), which were estimated to have caused <em>1–4 million deaths each</em>. The first influenza pandemic of the 21st century occurred in 2009–2010 and was caused by an <em>influenza A(H1N1)</em> virus which was <em>Severity-1</em> pandemic as compared to 1918-1919 Spanish Flu which was <em>Severity-5</em> pandemic. <br><h3>There is a significant difference between previous pandemics and this pandemic.</h3> Covid-19 has caused many countries around the world to enforce complete lockdown of the public. While previous pandemics caused some travels restrictions, Covid-19 has forced world’s largest economies for complete lockdown of the cities as well as borders. The world order at the time of Spanish Flu and Covid-19 is totally different. The world has changed so much in 20th century not only in political domain but in economic, industrial, technological and in social domain as well. <br><br><h3>The world had essentially become a Global Village by the end of 20th century and had become used to it by 2020. But Covid-19 has started to challenge this global system and raised a need for new social, educational, health, economic, industrial and to some extent new political system.</h3> Social interaction and social gatherings have been reduced to almost zero. People who used to spend their days and nights in offices or with friends, have been with their families for past many weeks. Economies dependent on conventional industries are facing huge loss.   One estimate from an expert at Washington University in St. Louis gave a <em>$300+ billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years</em>. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly "scrambled" after a steep decline in oil prices due to lower demand from China. Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. The retail sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in store hours or temporary closures. <em>Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60% drop. This also resulted in a 33–43% drop in foot traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February</em>. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, <em>the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people</em> in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been in that situation without the pandemic. In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, <em>about 5 million people in China lost their jobs</em>. Many of China's nearly <em>300 million rural migrant workers</em> have been stranded at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. Nearly <em>17 million Americans lost their jobs</em> and applied for government aid, including <em>2.4 million people in California</em>. The coronavirus outbreak <em>could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and unemployment rate may hit 32%</em>, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily wages) unemployed. The survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that <em>44% of Canadian households</em> have experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly <em>900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain</em> since it went into lockdown in mid-March 2020. During the second half of March, <em>4 million French workers</em> applied for temporary unemployment benefits and <em>1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme</em>. Almost half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers on a government-subsidized short-time working schemes known as Kurzarbeit. <br><br><h3>And just to remember that these statistics are only for first 3 months of the pandemic.</h3><br>
            Pakistan, an economically strained, politically divided, socially struggling country is no exception to this situation. As of 13 April,2020 Pakistan has <em>5,011 confirmed cases with 77 deaths</em>. On 2 April, the Government of Pakistan announced that the <em>Pakistani economy had lost Rs2.5 trillion due to the coronavirus pandemic</em>. The Ministry of Planning has estimated that <em>12.3 million to 18.5 million people will become jobless due to pandemic</em>. On 24 March, <em>the Prime Minister approved a Rs1.2 trillion economic relief package</em>. Of this, a total of Rs150 billion was allotted for low-income groups, particularly laborers while 280 billion rupees ($1.76 billion) was assigned for wheat procurement. Loan interest payments for exporters were deferred temporarily, while a package of 100 billion rupees ($63 million) was provided to support small industries and the agriculture sector. There was also a significant reduction in petroleum prices and the public couple pay electricity and gas bills below a certain amount in installments. <br><br><h3>Pakistan which has been struggling to stabilize its economy after government of PTI formed government and was getting successful slowly but steadily in doing so, has been forced to spend economic gains of its last 2 years to fight this pandemic.</h3><br>
            But things might not be that bad for Pakistan in all this dark situation. Pakistan, if plays well, can emerge stronger from this pandemic not only economically but politically and socially as well. <br><br><h3>This pandemic has equalized power dynamics of the region and world to some extent.</h3> There is a global race for discovery of vaccine of this pandemic and Pakistan is already in the race. Whoever wins this race or finishes among top spots will gain considerable soft power which is much needed in this time for Pakistan. Pakistan is already a part of SAARC initiative to fight Covid-19 and <em>has pledged 300 million USD to the fund</em>. On 22 March, <em>Prime Minister Imran Khan urged the United States President Donald Trump to temporarily lift sanctions on Iran.</em> He stated on Twitter, 'I want to appeal to President Trump on humanitarian grounds to lift the sanctions against Iran till the COVID-19 pandemic is over.' The same day, the Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi raised the <em>issue of external debt faced by the country</em> and how it should be relieved in repayment of loans on the phone with Heiko Maas, <em>the German Foreign Minister</em>. Qureshi reportedly told Maas that united efforts were required for dealing with the pandemic and that debt relief could help Pakistan in better handling of the outbreak in the country. He further stated that <em>sanctions on Iran should be lifted immediately</em> so it could utilize its own resources to fight the ongoing outbreak there. In response, Maas assured him that the issues would be raised at the forthcoming G7 meeting and the European Union Foreign Ministers Conference next week. He also echoed the need to lift sanctions on Iran on calls with the <em>French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian</em> and <em>the Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez</em> on 24 March. These diplomatic moves would matter a lot once this pandemic is gone and will give Pakistan an edge over its strategic and diplomatic competitors. China is a time-proven ally of Pakistan and has more or less same strategic interests in the region. China has started to ease its lockdowns after a fall of cases in the country. If adopted same strategy, Pakistan might become one of the earliest countries to get rid of this pandemic. Which means that it would give Pakistan a head start for resuming economic activities. Environment is probably only factor which has cashed this pandemic at its best and it has been getting better and better gradually. The worldwide disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic has resulted in numerous impacts on the environment and the climate. The severe decline in planned travel has caused many regions to experience a drop in air pollution. In China, lockdowns and other measures resulted in a <em>25 percent reduction in carbon emissions</em>, which one Earth systems scientist estimated <em>may have saved at least 77,000 lives over two months.</em> Pakistan’s government has taken an <em>innovative initiative</em> and has used its jobless daily wagers to work for National Tree Plantation Drive. This would give a boost to the speed of the project and it might be completed when Covid-19 ends. This on one hand will provide live hood to lower class of Pakistan’s society and on the other hand will help Pakistan stand out in International Community as an Environment Friendly Leading country. This situation has given a chance of revival to Health, Education and IT sector as well. Pakistan is among top 5 freelancing countries of the world. With most of its freelancers free now, <em>Pakistan can increase its software exports</em>. Pakistan can use this sector for not only IT sector but to help Health sector by developing <em>e-Health systems</em>, to education sector by developing <em>reliable and quality systems for online education</em>. Last but not least, this force can be used to help government in <em>E-Governance</em> sector as well.<br><br>
            No one is sure when this pandemic will end. Even once it is gone, there are many chances that it may strike again and again. <br><br><h3>Covid-19 has exposed loopholes in social, political and economic order of the contemporary world.</h3> It is not a Sprint; it is a Marathon. And countries will have to fill their loopholes as soon as possible. Superpowers no more rely on military for their sustenance, that was a 20th century fashion. Today’s world and future one’s will require <em>Diplomacy</em> (US-Taliban deal is a recent Example), <em>Soft Power</em> and <em>Technology</em> for a country to be an influential player of the world.<br><br><h3>This pandemic might just have given us that chance. It is entirely up to us now to decide whether to move one step ahead of the time and take lead, or wait for the others to lead us.</h3>
