				As Pakistan celebrated its 22nd Youm-e-Takbir (Anniversary of becoming a Nuclear Power), situation at both LOC (Line of Control) and LAC (Line of Actual Contact) is posing a threat to peace of the region. With China’s presence inside Indian territory at LAC, questions are being asked why Pakistan is not advancing inside LOC as China did at LAC. There are also some voices which are asking what is the use of our atomic power if we cannot use it for coercion or for employment in the battlefield. Then there are some people asking why are we not sending our Army in Kashmir as India is on its way to change its demography? Some give example of Iran-vs-USA, DPRK (North Korea)-vs-USA or China-vs-USA of how these countries are bravely standing against world’s most powerful military might while Pakistan is behaving being afraid of Indian atomic power. Many of these voices belong to groups motivated by religious speakers and some rely upon their own analysis. Then, there is another extreme group in our society which thinks that Pakistan’s armed forces are simply no match for Indian forces. All these opinions finally lead to ambiguity on effectiveness of Pakistan’s nuclear capability so a question is to be answered is that What is the role of Pakistan’s Nuclear Program in its defense infrastructure?

				</figure><br>
				One of the major short-coming in all these arguments and objections is that these are made without taking nuclear strategy in consideration. Although no one can be blamed for this because this domain is one of the most least discussed topic in the country but it is imperative to take it into consideration because if we are talking about nuclear bomb then then a logical discussion must start from when and where this bomb is used (in other words Nuclear Strategy). Unfortunately, most of our public only follow the example of US droppings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki which were based on “Massive Retaliation Strategy”. It is one of the earliest and inflexible strategy which is considered outdated and obsolete. At the time of Hiroshima incident, nuclear technology was less just 19 days old as a weapon technology. After witnessing apocalyptic end-state of this technology, new strategies were formulated like gradual deterrence, flexible response and gradual escalation. But all these strategies turned out to be intellectually untenable.
				<br/><h3>“All three concepts implied the ability to manage the employment of nuclear weapons, so the central question became: could nuclear war be controlled? and the answer from too many analysts was ‘No’. The suggestion that leaders would respond to a nuclear attack in a measured, carefully calibrated way was simply unsustainable. Confronting possible national annihilation, those leaders might find it difficult to resist the temptation to minimize their own losses by getting in first with a massive strike of their own.” (Making Sense of War)</h3>
				Most credible nuclear strategy until now has been Mutual Deterrence or Mutual Assure Destruction (MAD). MAD is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender. This nuclear strategy was the most effective driving force behind averting direct conflict between USSR and USA throughout Cold War era. MAD is also the same strategy which being applied in South-Asian region as well by China, India and Pakistan. But as these three countries share border with each other, have serious border disputes among them and all three have sophisticated nuclear technology, things are much more sensitive and complex than the case of Cold War.

				Nuclear Weapons are not regular weapons who cause a controlled and directed damage. These are weapons of mass destruction whose damage is not controllable. Hence these weapons are used differently than conventional weapons. A layman’s explanation of this fact can be understood that you don’t buy a bus as a family conveyance. For family, we buy a car and for single person we use a bike. For small family of 3-4 people, we buy a 5-seat vehicle while for a family larger number we buy an 8-seat vehicle. Although a family of 4 or 8 people can be easily be accommodated in a bus but a bus is only used for mass transportation. It means that we deploy our resources according to our need and use a resource only for the purpose for which it was developed. Similar is the case with war strategy. Every weapon is used for the purpose it was developed for example tanks are not used in high altitude warfare, pistols and SMGs are used in close combat but snipers are not. Nuclear weapons are not a weapon of offense but are purely weapons of deterrence (discouraging/preventing other states from attacking with their nuclear weapons, through the promise of retaliation and massive/complete destruction). In 75 years, history of nuclear weapons, nuclear weapons were used for offense only on 20th and 23rd day of its development. Pakistan also developed nuclear weapons for deterrence but unlike any other nuclear state before, her nuclear development did not have a motivation factor of increasing national power for regional or global dominance. 
				Although Pakistan’s nuclear doctrines remains classified till date to maintain the element of secrecy and surprise but it is widely believed that Pakistan’s Nuclear Employment strategy is based on four stages approach
				<br/><h3>“The first step could be a public or private warning, the second a demonstration explosion of a small nuclear weapon on its own soil, the third step would be the use of a few nuclear weapons on its own soil against Indian attacking forces. The fourth stage would be used against critical but purely military targets in India across the border from Pakistan. Probably in thinly populated areas in the desert or semi-desert, causing least collateral damage. this may prevent Indian retaliation against cities in Pakistan.” (Lt Gen Retd. Sardar FS Lodi; former operational commander of Pakistan's joint special forces command)</h3>
				As per statement of high officials of Pakistan’s NCA and publications of IISS nuclear weapons may be used by Pakistan when one or more four situations arise (exact conditions remain still classified when these situations would be considered to be met).
				<ol>
					<li>The military penetration of Indian Armed Forces into Pakistan on a large scale may elicit a nuclearized massive retaliation, if and only if the Pakistan Army is unable to stop such intervention.</li>
					<li>The complete knockout or comprehensive destruction of a large part of the Pakistan Armed Forces, particularly and most importantly the Pakistan Air Force (PAF), could lead to a quick nuclear response if Islamabad believed that it was losing the cohesiveness of its defense and feared imminent defeat. According to the PAF, this threshold would also be breached by the use of chemical or biological weapons against Pakistan, and would provoke a massive retaliation.</li>
					<li>Economic strangulation and economic blockade is also a potential threat to Pakistan, if the Navy is unable to counter it effectively.</li>
					<li>A destabilization of the country by India could also be a nuclear threshold if Islamabad has credible reasons to believe that the integrity of the country was at stake. One example would be encouraging the breakaway of one or more of Pakistan's provinces (as in during the Bangladesh Liberation War).</li>
				</ol>

				On the other hand, India published an official nuclear doctrine on January 04, 2003 with following points.
				<ol>
					<li>India’s stance will be to build and maintain a credible minimum deterrent.</li>
					<li>Main punch of India’s stance will be "No First Use", but these will be used against nuclear attack, in retaliation, on territory or on its forces. This retaliation will be massive and effect unbearable damage.</li>
					<li>Civil political leadership only can authorize these retaliation attacks, naming Nuclear Command Authority.</li>
					<li>Non-nuclear states will not be hit by nuclear weapons. But, in case of major attack (biological or chemical), India will have the option of nuclear weapons.</li>
					<li>Strict control on the export of fissile material as mentioned in Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty (FMCT) declaration will be followed.</li>
					<li>India will strictly follow the guidelines for a nuclear free world on nondiscriminatory basis on all across the globe.</li>
				</ol>
				A common factor in Indian and Pakistani Nuclear doctrine is that both tend to maintain Credible Minimum Deterrence. But this CMD differ for both India and Pakistan. According to Amit Gupta in the Armed Forces Journal of September 1998, many analysts agree that India requires 100 to 150 nuclear weapons as a deterrent against China and Pakistan as a minimum. In Pakistan a minimum deterrent could range between 30 to 50 nuclear weapons. But at the same time there are also huge differences in both doctrines. Among them, biggest difference is of “No First Use” policy. India has clearly stated in its Nuclear Doctrine about its commitment with “No First Use” policy while Pakistan has never stated any such policy. Although Indian Defense Minister stated in Aug,2019 that India may change and back-off from its NFU policy if situation demands, there are no further official discussion regarding this issue. Another point to note is that Nuclear paradigm is much more center of Pakistan’s national defense as compared to that of India which relies mainly on its conventional military power.
				So, what part does Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent play in our region? First and immediate result of Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent came as change in India’s tune after his nuclear explosions of 1998. As noted by Lt. Gen. Retd Lodhi noted 
				
				<br/><h3>“After acquiring nuclear weapons capability India's stance towards Pakistan completely changed. Mr. L. K. Advani the pro-nuclear Indian home minister made statements showing India's intention to cross the Line of Control in Kashmir under the pretext of 'hot pursuit'. These statements were supported and often repeated by Indian-occupied Kashmir's chief minister Dr Farooq Abdullah. The Indian Corps Commander in Kashmir Lt. Gen Kishan Pal addressed an unprecedented news conference to advocate his plans of attacking Azad Kashmir territory across the Line of Control. These provocative statements could not have been made without Delhi's approval. These were followed by appropriate military moves by India. An extra infantry division was sent into Kashmir and another one was placed at short notice to move. During my tour to the Line of Control the local army commanders informed me that India had started to dump artillery and other ammunition into forward locations. This is often a prelude to war.
				With Pakistan's atomic tests her nuclear weapons capability was overtly demonstrated for all to see: friends and foes alike. It was surprising to note that India's aggressive tone based on her military muscle immediately changed for the better. There was now talk of peace and negotiations. The war hysteria seemed to have subsided. This is what deterrence is all about. By a demonstrated nuclear capability and parity on either side of the border, a form of defense equilibrium has been restored between India and Pakistan. If not disturbed any further this should augur well for future peace in the region.”</h3>

				Primary focus of Pakistan’s deterrent was not for offense against India or any other adversary but defense purpose. Unfortunately, in South Asia a balance of power cannot be maintained by conventional means alone. Owing primarily to India's sheet size and ample resources. India is larger than all her neighbors combined, in South Asia by a wide margin. Add to this India's ambitions across her frontiers in the region and beyond and you have a situation fraught with long-term defense and security implications for Pakistan. India maintains a defense budget five times greater than Pakistan and has at-least double number of conventional forces on average. Pakistan not only achieved balance of power in nuclear domain against India but also reduced conventional dominance of India to a large extent. When viewed in the perspective of Kashmir, it is no exception from nuclear strategy of Pakistan. Unless there is no incursion of Indian forces in Pakistan’s side of Kashmir to an extent which threatens its national security, use of nuclear option is clearly out of discussion. As per stated doctrine, India’s current actions in IOK does not cross any of the threshold of Pakistan’s national security. Kashmir issue and Indian steps in the valley are clearly a huge concern for Pakistan but it remains purely a political issue and demands a political solution.<br/>

				<br/>There’s a huge difference between current offensive posture of China at LAC against India is compared with that of Pakistan’s against later at LOC. Major reason behind this is that a stand-off between China and India at LAC has always been purely in conventional domain and there is very low possibility of this issue turning to nuclear conflict. While in the case of India-Pakistan standoff, this possibility is very high because there is a huge asymmetry in conventional forces of both sides. Another reason is that LAC issue is an issue about demarcation of boundary line which has not been marked and has not been agreed upon officially. It is also lightly guarded in most areas and not mainly fenced. While in case of Kashmir it is not demarcation issue rather it is an issue of entire Kashmir region. LOC is officially demarcated, highly guarded and accepted by both sides a temporary boundary until Kashmir issue is resolved. Hence movement of troops across LAC is very easy and casual activity as compared to movement across LOC. Another aspect of Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent and Kashmir issue that later is purely a political issue. Making this issue a religious touch would be hypocritic move because Muslims have and are suffering in Burma, Middle East, Palestine and even in China but how many times we have asked our government use nuclear or even conventional armed response to these situations. Kashmir is a political issue; it’s a reality and we have to accept this reality sooner or later. 
				Kashmir might be a paramount priority of Pakistan but existence of Pakistan comes first and with it comes a responsibility of lives of more than 200 million Pakistanis. Those voices raising ambiguity on Pakistan’s motivation and resolve for employment of nuclear weapons have no answer for end state of a war in South Asia which would definitely go nuclear at some point. It does not matter who starts, once triggered there would be not much Pakistan, India as well as Kashmir left to join either side. Pakistan and India both possess Second Strike Capability which means that it doesn’t how much larger nuclear strike is launched by one side; other side would still have capability to respond to incur huge/total destruction of the initiator country. Attack is not the only strategy; neither in western nor in Islamic history. Holy Prophet (PBUH) withdrew from Battle of Uhud battlefield to a higher ground to avoid total defeat. He used defensive strategy in Battle of Khandaq by digging trenches around Madina to avoid fighting Non-Muslims were in much stronger position than Muslims. He maintained Balance of Power by signing alliance with Jews of Madina and adding them into defense mechanism of Madina. He used Diplomacy and Conciliation at Hudaibiyah pact to stabilize Madina’s economic and political situation. He did not go to Makkah after winning at Badr because time was not right. He went to Makkah when he knew that Non-Muslims of Makkah were now not in the position of fighting. There were believers in Makkah at the time of Badr, Uhud, Khandaq, Hudaibiyah but he did not approached Makkah to liberate them. He did it only when the time was right. It is not a question of cowardness, it a question of sense. Holy Prophet (PBUH) prayed for survival of Muslims and victory at the time of Badr because if they lose, there would be not any Islam left to fight for. 
				<br/><h3>It is not a question of bravery, it a question of sense.</h3>
