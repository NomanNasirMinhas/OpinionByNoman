				The recent wave of COVID-19 across the globe has increased pressure on Health Infrastructure in the world including Pakistan. Lack of Personal Protection Equipment (PPEs), lack of ventilators and other facilities in hospital caused some to raise a concern in Pakistan that it should have focused its spending on developmental projects in the same way as it focused on defense projects. This point holds validity because Pakistan’s defense spending accounts for about 15.8% (1.152 Trillion Rs) of total government expenditures while it is only 0.15% (11.058 Billion Rs) for Health Sector, 1.06% (77.262 Billion Rs) for Education Sector and so on in Fiscal Year 2019-2020. Almost every government, whether civil or military, has adopted same approach in budget allocation. Pakistan has been essentially a Security State since is genesis and focused most of its financial and administrative effort on its security institutions. This concern cannot be ruled out but it is only one side of the picture. This approach emerged out of necessity rather than of choice. Pakistan’s defense concern is mostly attributed with India but it is not the case. Pakistan’s biggest demand for strengthening its security institutions came from not only India but more importantly, its geographical location and international politics. 
				Among all three above factors, Pakistan’s geographical location has given some the biggest challenges as it has provided us geo-strategic benefit. Pakistan at the time of Independence was not defense centric and had its focus on internal stability and economic development. But a pre-partition pact between British and Afghanistan on Durand Line caused Afghanistan to vote against Pakistan’s membership at United Nation which provided India an enemy of Pakistan’s. Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, was a great believer of Chankiya Kautaliya and working on one of his principle of Foreign Policy “My Enemy’s Enemy is my Friend”, Nehru initiated diplomatic relations with Afghanistan. In 1950, both countries signed The Treaty of Peace and pledged closed relations with each other. Pakistan had been caught between India &amp; Afghanistan and Pakistan’s geography caused its first challenge.

				</figure><br>
				1948 Kashmir War had forced Pakistan to develop its military infrastructure from scratch because Pakistan had inherited no defense industry from British India and most of its military senior leadership (like civil bureaucracy) was comprised of British officers. This had caused a lot of trouble in 1948 Kashmir War when Commander-in-Chief of that time Gen. Douglas McArthur, a British Officer, had refused to deploy troops in Kashmir on the order of Governor General Muhammad Ali Jinnah. To improve defense and economy as well Pakistan decided to join two US-led military alliance named SEATO and CENTO. These two pacts not only provided Pakistan with military aid but also financial assistance. This was Cold War Era and India along with Afghanistan (which was then relatively strong country) to criticize Pakistan at International forums as “an internationalist strategy of criticizing countries that entered into military pacts with big powers sought to isolate Pakistan in Asia and Africa” writes Avinash Paliwal. Up to this point, India had tried diplomatic strategies to isolate and humiliate Pakistan in international community but that all changed after 1965 War. Before 1965, Pakistan was going very well in economic development was focused on internal matters rather than concerning itself with India. Pakistan’s External Security concerns played very little role in its internal policies and actions but it all changed afterwards.<br> 
				1965 War, which was initiated due Pakistan’s proactive action on Kashmir through an operation named Operation Gibraltar, had changed power struggle of South Asia forever. India had was in a political turmoil before 1965 War due death of PM Nehru. Moreover, India had been bashed by China in 1962 Sino-Indian war. Taking this situation as advantage Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto who was foreign minister at that time, convinced President Ayub Khan to launch a military operation to liberate Indian Occupied Kashmir. Intelligence agencies of Pakistan voted against this situation and assessed that situation was not in favor of Pakistan. But Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto persisted and was able to get this operation approved from the President. No time was allotted for military planning and execution of this operation and neither Air Force nor Naval Chief was informed of this operation. As expected, operation failed soon and 1965 War was initiated. No side could gain absolute victory and on 20 Sept, UN passed resolution for ceasefire. After ceasefire between countries, India uplifted its efforts to disintegrate Pakistan to a new level.

				<h3>“……India unleashed a systematic counter offensive on Pashtunistan, Balochistan, East-Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir……... A serving member of (Indian) Parliament, Col. Retd. Bashir ul Hassan was dispatched to Afghanistan to meet Ghaffar Khan in late-September and explore the possibility of reigniting the Pashtunistan Issue. ‘The 85-year-old leader was full of vigor and enthusiastic about waging his struggle for emancipation from Pakistan’s rule’. Within India, the Pakhtoon Jirga-e-Hind also pressurized (Indian) government to move beyond war of words. In November 1965……..., EAM (External Affairs Minister) Swaran Singh invited Ghaffar Khan to resume his struggle for Pashtun Independence from Indian soil and promised all support that he would require in that pursuit.” (My Enemy’s Enemy by Avinash Paliwal)</h3><br>
				India also started financial and military support anti-Pakistan factions in Balochistan and East-Pakistan in addition to diplomatic support. This automatically generated a reaction from Pakistan. As these were proxy war, hence Pakistan could not engage in direct confrontation with Indians and had to keep a check on anti-Pakistan factions in Balochistan, NWFP (now KPK) and East-Pakistan. This resulted in dismissal of provincial governments and military operations in these areas. This era started involvement of military opinion in handling of internal matters because countering proxies of India and Afghanistan presented Pakistan an existential threat and fell under domain of military. Political instability and prolonged martial law complemented to further enhance influence of military in these policies. Not only internal matters, but foreign policy of Pakistan became more security oriented which was focused more on political and progressive role before 1965. Lack of Political Consensus, continuous challenge to writ of the state and failing law and order situation left Pakistan with no option except to use force of military to handle situation of the country which could have been avoided through political solution. Again, geography played its part and East-Pakistan, which was roughly 1000 miles apart from its western wing, claimed and gained independence under shadow of Indian Military on 16 December,1971.<br><br>

				</figure><br>
				Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, after taking charge first as President and then Prime Minister of Pakistan, tried to normalize relationship of Pakistan with both its neighbors and with world’s powers. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, ex-Foreign Minister, use his diplomatic skills to not only normalize relations with USSR (which played vital role against Pakistan in 1971 war) but with Bangladesh and all Muslim countries including Afghanistan. This decade might have given Bhutto to limit the role of military in internal and external affairs of Pakistan but another challenge emerged which again demanded enhanced military cooperation (or even involvement) with civil government. After 1971 war, realizing conventional weaker military strength as compared to India and knowledge of Indian nuclear program, Pakistan had started its initial nuclear research in 1972 but it was in 1974 which complexed power dimensions of South Asia even further when India conducted its first Nuclear Test “Smiling Buddha”. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto pledging to make Pakistan a nuclear power by raising slogan of “We will make atomic bomb too, even if we have to eat grass”, in order to restore Balance of Power in the region, ordered Pakistan’s nuclear program to become in full swing. Although Pakistan’s nuclear program was headed by civil scientists like Dr. Abdus Salam and Dr. Munir Ahmed Khan but most crucial job was dedicated to Pakistan’s military and intelligence services which was a) to get mechanical parts to start enrichment of Uranium; and b) to maintain secrecy and security of both nuclear facilities and staff working on the project. This gave military an upper hand again in civil administration. Meanwhile Indian collaboration with Afghanistan was continued keeping situation on western border tensed. 
				<h3>“(Indra) Gandhi’s confidante and Indian ambassador to Moscow, D P Dhar, had asked foreign secretary Trilok Nath Kaul to suggest Kabul to ‘help the oppressed East Bengalis materially by reviving their vocal interest in the Pakhtoon Movement’” (Wikileaks)</h3><br>

				<h3>“In 1975, Balochistan Liberation Front had shifted its headquarter from Balochistan to Afghanistan. Despite underlying tensions between Pashtun and Baloch nationalism, Kabul threw its weight behind separatists. Recruiting fighters from Baloch and Pashtun refugee camps that were setup all across the border area, it launched attacks from its new headquarters in Kandhar and the fort of Kalat-i-Ghazali, just out of Kandhar. Three forward operating bases were also setup along the border near Chaman, Dohmandi and Gulistan areas.” (Wikileaks)</h3><br>

				At this time, Pakistan did not just face India and Afghanistan but there was another actor which was making contact with Baloch and Pashtun separatists, which was Iraq. Iraq, in order to destabilize eastern Iran, started supporting separatists in Balochistan on both Pakistani and Iranian side. This issue became open when Pakistan raided Iraqi embassy in Islamabad and retrieved a huge stock arms and ammunitions which was supposed to be delivered to separatists. This raid was not easy to do because Pakistani forces had to retrieve them from an embassy and if information of arms came wrong, Pakistan might have faced strong diplomatic and legal action, not just from Iraq but from around the world. This raid became main driver of dismissal of NAP government of KPK in 1973. All of this complex and multifront threat had set Pakistan’s military in driving seat of Pakistan’s local and foreign policies. As if all this drama was not enough for Pakistan, International Politics added further action in the already sensitive security situation of the region. From 1972 to 1979, Pakistan continued dealing with India, Afghanistan, Iraq and separatist movements of Pashtunistan and Balochistan. But on 27 December, 1979 another actor was added into the region when Soviet Union had moved troops into Afghanistan. Till then political leaders of both Pakistan and India had changed with Gen Zia ul Haqq and Charan Singh respectively in power.<br><br>

				</figure><br>
				Soviet Union sitting on the western border of Pakistan, a Western Allied country which had provided base for US U-2 spy plane to conduct survey missions over USSR, was more than enough reason for both Pakistan and USA to act quickly, strongly and effectively. This situation and a strong military ruler in Pakistan were more than enough reasons for military take absolute charge of the country. This grave security concern of both USA and Pakistan can be observed from the fact that CIA launched largest covert operation of its history to counter USSR by supplying financial and military aid to Pakistan. With USSR, India had little play in Afghanistan but when USSR withdrew India again found a strong anti-Pakistan ally in Afghanistan in the form of Najibullah which also had support from KGB. From USSR withdrawal to 1999 coup of Gen Parvez Musharraf, military went on backfoot (to comparatively huge extent) and civilian government had a chance through which it could have made some difference. But civilian governments missed this chance. Although no strong General as compared to Gen Zia and Gen Ayub had been in command of the military during this period, political tussle between PPP and PML(N) did not allowed democratic institution to stabilize in the country. Intelligence agencies were used to keep check on rival political parties rather than on national security concerns. Although Benazir Bhutto tried to bring ISI under civil administration but had failed. Up to India’s atomic tests of 1998, Pakistan’s response to those tests, civil-military relationships had deteriorated to a huge extent. This situation became clear when Kargil Operation was launched by then military chief Gen Parvez Musharraf without getting (final if not initial) approval of PM Nawaz Sharif. Pakistani forces had penetrated into Indian territory but PM ordered forces back. This finally ended when Gen Parvez Musharraf became Chief Executive of the country in October,1999 after a dramatic coup. The situation was relatively calm when 9/11 happened and Pakistan was left with “Either you are with us or against us” choice. So called War-on-Terror again as an international politics factor raised Pakistan’s security concerns and military was again pushed into a long struggle against insurgency. From Lal Mosque Operation, Operation Rah-e-Rast to Operation Zarb-e-Azb, Karachi Operation and Operation Radd-ul-Fassad, Pakistan had little choice than to be Security State.<br><br>

				</figure><br>
				Toady Operation Radd-ul-Fassad in late-mid phase, Democracy has persisted for about 2 decades, US had agreed to withdraw from Afghanistan but there is one concern which is still there. Pakistan here might have a chance of transition from Security State to Welfare State but security threat from Indian side, especially after Pulwama Attack, scrapping of Article 370 and new citizen act in Kashmir will continue to be a priority of Pakistani government. South Asia have escaped an all-out Nuclear War between two rivals on a night after Abhinandan’s capture when India was ready to launch missile attacks on 6-7 sights in Pakistan. Pakistan’s civil and military leadership contacted and warned international community of the situation and its consequences before launching a counter strike. This moved averted the danger but with BJP’s strong nationalist party in power, strong public opinion in Pakistan about Kashmir issue and India’s increasing influence in the Indian Ocean and on international economy, Pakistan would have to walk on a very tight rope balancing between becoming a welfare state and maintaining Balance of Power in the region.
