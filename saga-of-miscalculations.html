				With increased tensions in Kashmir region between China, India and Pakistan peace of South Asian region is again at risk. Kashmir issue has been in lime light since Modi government came in power in 2014. Since then, Indian side of Kashmir has not just seen increased activities of Indian Forces in the region but also that of Kashmiri Mujahideen. The other stakeholder of Kashmir issue, Pakistan, came into play when Pakistan’s PTI party came into power for the first time of its history in 2018. After 2018, Pakistan has increased international political and diplomatic engagements on every multinational forum. After Pulwama Attack on Indian forces on 14 Feb, 2019, Kashmir issue became highlighted on international level once again which remained essentially dormant before this incident. As the region gradually moved towards a full-scale war between two border sharing countries which had high possibility of going nuclear, international actors had to intervene before things got out of hand. President of USA, Donald Trump, had to offer mediation between India and Pakistan at multiple instances despite strong objections of the Indian side. These types of mediation offer are not effective until both sides agree for mediation, which seems impossible from the Indian side. So, it raises a question about what options does Pakistan has now about Kashmir issue? And even before this, how did Kashmir issue become so complex as it is today?

				When Radcliff Award was made public on 17 August, 1947 both Pakistan and Indian sides had their reservations about the award. But the biggest conflict emerged when Kashmir could not decide its future. Pakistan made its first operational mistake when it could not move its armed forces intime to prevent Indian forces from entering Sri Nagar and taking control of Kashmir. Although Pakistan reacted at a much later time but till then damage was done. Pakistan was able to take control of a part of Kashmir which became Azad Kashmir. Pakistan’s second operational mistake or blunder came in the form of Operation Gibraltar in 1965. Although Operation was a strategically fine but its operational execution was extremely ill-planned and ill-executed. These both mistakes might not have done that much damage to the Kashmir cause as next mistake did which was done at strategic level. After loss of 1971 war in Eastern sector, more than 90000 Pakistani became war prisoners to India. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who had just taken over as President of Pakistan, had to somehow get those prisoners back. So, a pact was signed on 2 July,1972 in Simla, Himachal Pardesh, India between Indian PM Indra Gandhi and President Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Main two points of this pact were
				<ol>
				<li>Both countries will "settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations". India has, many a times, maintained that Kashmir dispute is a bilateral issue and must be settled through bilateral negotiations as per Simla Agreement, 1972 and thus, had denied any third party intervention even that of United Nations.</li>
				<li>The agreement converted the cease-fire line of 17 December 1971 into the Line of Control (LOC) between India and Pakistan and it was agreed that "neither side shall seek to alter it unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations".</li>
				</ol>

				</figure><br>
				If seen in the perspective of situations of 1972, this agreement was heavily in the favor of Pakistan and it has nothing to lose in this pact. This pact was fine for short term goals but it was not accessed in long term objectives of Pakistan. What Pakistani delegate failed to take into account was changing strategic environment of the world and specially Asia. After USA and Russia became nuclear state in 1945 and 1949, China also pursued this track and became nuclear in 1964. India had already started his nuclear research before its independence through Bhabha research institute. India had research, motivation, will and diplomatic influence to get nuclear technology. At that Pakistan lacked all of these factors. What Z.A Bhutto did not realize at that time was that India will definitely go nuclear in presence of a nuclear China and Pakistan would also have to follow the track. Introduction of nuclear factor in any conflict reduces chances of aggression specially if both sides possess this technology. Cold War had come out of Cuban Missile Crisis 1962 which had proved this point. This ignorance of nuclear factor greatly complicated the issue. Although no side had nuclear technology at that time, but India became tested its so called PNE (Peaceful Nuclear Explosion) just 2 years after this pact. Main strategy behind this pact from Pakistani side was based on Balance of Power in a non-nuclear environment. But Pakistan failed to achieve this strategy. Pakistan could not achieve balance of Power partially due to its own internal issue and partially due to Indian acts. Both point of Pakistan’s strategy had failed with 1974 Smiling Buddha nuclear test of India. There was neither a non-nuclear environment in South Asia anymore, nor Balance of Power was there in the region anymore. Pakistan could not do much solid as related to Kashmir as long as there was no Balance of Power in the region. This can be assessed from the fact that from 1947 to 1974, both sides had engaged in 3 major armed conflicts in 27 years while from 1974 to 1998 there were no major escalation in these 24 years except Operation Meghdoot and Operation Brasstacks. Even with the full support of USA from 1979 to 1989, Pakistan could not put effective pressure on India related to Kashmir issue. In 1998, India became fully nuclear by testing its nuclear bombs for official military purposes. Pakistan replied by testing its own nuclear weapons and hence Balance of power was restored to some extent. India had not formulated its cold start doctrine yet and was not ready for a low-level, limited scale war. This provided Pakistan with a loophole in Indian military strategy and COAS of that time Gen. Parvez Musharraf opened a front at Kargil in 1999. This operation might be strategically effective but repeating this mistake of Operation Gibraltar, was ill-coordinated. There was confusion and disagreement between military and civil government over this issue which resulted in withdrawal of Pakistan’s military from its positions which it had occupied in Indian territory.

					  <figcaption class="figure-caption" style="text-align: center;">Kargil Conflict Map</figcaption>
				</figure><br>
				A huge considerable pressure from international community and PM Nawaz Shareef’s disagreement with Gen Musharraf led to another stalemate between now two nuclear states. Although India and Pakistan both conducted their nuclear tests in 1998, but it was Pakistan which had to face more strict sanctions than India. Reason behind this was that India had been declared nuclear state in 1974 and at that time Non-Proliferation Treaty had recently came into effect in 1970. In 1998, NPT became an internationally accepted treaty with only 4 countries who were non-signatories of it (Pakistan, India, Israel, India &amp; North Korea) at that time. So as Pakistan was testing its first nuclear devices, it had to face more international pressure. Pakistan had not yet recovered from aftermath of Kargil conflict due to political chaos in the country that 9/11 incident took place. Pakistan had shift focus of its military from its eastern border to its western border. Meanwhile Pakistan was engaged in WOT, India came under Mumbai attacks of 2008 which lasted for 4 days. India cashed this incident to its full potential while on the other side Pakistan took ignorant silence on the matter. Whatever is happening today in Kashmir on Indian side was encouraged by Pakistan’s steps after 2008. Before 2008, Pakistan despite having ups and downs in strategic and operational domains had kept its diplomatic front open and active. But after 2008, Pakistani diplomatic force was silenced damaging its Kashmir cause every new day. Pakistani diplomats literally stopped talking on Kashmir issue during 2008-2018 era. Former R&amp;AW chief A.S Daulat states in his book Spy Chronicles, that when Indian diplomats asked their Pakistani counterparts about discussion on their core issue of Kashmir, Pakistani diplomats used to say ‘Leave it’. This encouraged and convinced Indian government that Pakistan was out of Kashmir game and no more cared about it. What came next was even worse i.e. BJP Government. Although, BJP had come into power in 2014 but it was its second term in 2019 which gave it public confidence in the from of 21 more seats than 2014 elections to pursue its current policies. It is important to note that in 2014, BJP Leader Narendar Modi contested from both Varanasi and Vadodara but in 2019, he contested only from Varanasi. Varanasi is a city in Uttar Pardesh on banks of river Ganges. Varanasi is the religious hub of Hinduism and holiest city among Sapta Puri (Seven Sacred Sites). It was clear sign that Modi was no trying to emerge as religious leader of Hindu and would take steps in this regard. Consequently, steps like scrapping Article 370 &amp; 35(A), NRC of Assam, triple Talaq bill and Citizenship Act were taken in first year of its government.

				</figure><br>
				So what options are left for Pakistan. First thought to cross a common person is a retaliatory action which is totally out of question in the present environment of Pakistan. One may argue that if two nuclear states may enter into conflict through Kargil under nuclear umbrella, then why not now? But situation is greatly different than Kargil. First reason behind this is that both sides were very much immature in their nuclear strategy and nuclear technology. But after 20 years now, both countries have developed much mature nuclear doctrines as well as highly sophisticated delivery system. In conventional domain, Indian military was not prepared for a low profile, high altitude attack in 1999 but India has since changed its military strategy greatly after it formulated Cold Start Doctrine. Any country’s first priority is its survival, but in current condition as conflict will easily move towards nuclear war as seen in recent engagement of 2019 between both countries which would result in Mutual Assured Destruction. MAD is the only viable nuclear strategy in case of India and Pakistan due to geographical closeness and consequently virtually zero response time. Kashmir issue has been made complicated successively over a period of 70 years. It would be like living in a fool’s paradise if we consider it solvable in 5,10 years or so. Pakistan has two options left for Kashmir issue, one for short term and one for long term. For short term, Pakistan needs to continue its diplomatic engagements to all the major powers and stakeholders of international politics. Simla Pact has greatly reduced effectiveness of Mediation and UN resolutions for progress on Kashmir matter as per international law but has provided a benefit to Pakistan in the light of unilateral steps of India in Kashmir. Simla Pact recognized Kashmir and LOC as a bilateral subject and India’s unilateral scrapping of Article of 370, 35(A) and some parts of Citizenship Acts are direct violation of Simla Pact. Pakistan needs to highlight this aspect at all international forums. For long term, Pakistan needs to revert to strategy behind Simla Pact 1972 i.e. Balance of Power. Pakistan might have achieved balance in military power but is far behind India in terms of National Power. Pakistan needs to start building its national power to achieve viable Balance of Power. Pakistan needs to realize that haste is not a solution for Kashmir. Pakistan’s Political Leaders need to learn that rather than taking a hastily approach towards this issue to use it as a political achievement we need to make a gradual, patient and consistent efforts in economic, military, diplomatic and political domain to make this our national achievement. Kashmir is a war of equals rather than war of ego and we have to become equal to India to win this war.
