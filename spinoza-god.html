				Baruch Spinoza was a Dutch philosopher of Portuguese Sephardi origin. One of the early thinkers of the Enlightenment and modern biblical criticism, including modern conceptions of the self and the universe, he came to be considered one of the great rationalists of 17th-century philosophy. On 27 July 1656, the Talmud Torah congregation of Amsterdam issued a writ of <em>cherem</em> (a kind of ban, expulsion) against the 23-year-old Spinoza. The primary reason behind this expulsion was his view about religion and God. Spinoza argued that God exists and is abstract and impersonal.  He contended that everything that exists in Nature (i.e., everything in the Universe) is one Reality (substance) and there is only one set of rules governing the whole of the reality that surrounds us and of which we are part. Spinoza viewed God and Nature as two names for the same reality, namely a single, fundamental substance  that is the basis of the universe and of which all lesser "entities" are actually modes or modifications, that all things are determined by Nature to exist and cause effects, and that the complex chain of cause-and-effect is understood only in part. His identification of God with nature was more fully explained in his posthumously published Ethics. Spinoza's main contention with Cartesian mind–body dualism was that, if mind and body were truly distinct, then it is not clear how they can coordinate in any manner. Humans presume themselves to have free will, he argues, which is a result of their awareness of appetites that affect their minds, while being unable to understand the reasons why they desire what they desire and act as they do. These ideas might be very normal for a 21st century person but we are talking about 17th century in Europe. This was the era of Church’s absolute superiority. Europe considered religion as important as it considers science today. This was also the last era of European Wars of Religion.<br><br>

				 Thirty Years war had just ended and congress of Philadelphia had just occurred but it had not started to modify the world order yet. Church in Europe did not only exercise religious duties but also had immense political and judicial powers as well. But why are we discussing this man? Well, because this man had inspired the most brilliant scientific mind of human history i.e. Albert Einstein. Einstein’s religious views were heavily influenced by Spinoza.<br><br>
				<h3>I am not an Atheist. I do not know if I can define myself as a Pantheist. The problem involved is too vast for our limited minds. May I not reply with a parable? The human mind, no matter how highly trained, cannot grasp the universe. We are in the position of a little child, entering a huge library whose walls are covered to the ceiling with books in many different tongues. The child knows that someone must have written those books. It does not know who or how. It does not understand the languages in which they are written. The child notes a definite plan in the arrangement of the books, a mysterious order, which it does not comprehend, but only dimly suspects. That, it seems to me, is the attitude of the human mind, even the greatest and most cultured, toward God. We see a universe marvelously arranged, obeying certain laws, but we understand the laws only dimly. Our limited minds cannot grasp the mysterious force that sways the constellations. I am fascinated by Spinoza's Pantheism. I admire even more his contributions to modern thought. Spinoza is the greatest of modern philosophers, because he is the first philosopher who deals with the soul and the body as one, not as two separate things. (Albert Einstein, Glimpses of the Great:1930)</h3><br></p>

				</figure><br>
				<p>If we see today, most of the western world has set itself away from religion. They see religion as something which is barrier among them and inventions. The founder of this thought is Spinoza. Many of the Muslim youth follow the same thought as Spinoza’s unknowingly and see Islam in the same perspective. Spinoza’s thought might be interesting and very enlightened but they applied to the 17th century European social and religious order. These thoughts cannot be applied to Muslim community and those self-claimed scholars who think that Islam is a hindrance between have never tried to do in-depth research into Islamic philosophy. Spinoza followed the same notion as Islamic belief that human mind can not understand the Creator himself. One of the objections raised by modern scientists towards a religion is that it does not allow open research. This objection is not valid in case of Islam because Islam itself encourages humans to do research about space, its creation and celestial bodies behavior to see how organized this universe is. Quran says
				<h3>In the creation of the heavens and the earth; in the alternation of night and day; in the ships that sail the oceans for the benefit of mankind; in the water that Allah sends down from the sky, and revives the earth with it after it had died, and scatters in it all kinds of creatures; in the changing of the winds, and the clouds disposed between the sky and the earth; are signs for people who understand.  (al-Baqrah:164)</h3>
				<h3>To Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. Allah has power over all things. In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alternation of night and day, are signs for people of understanding. (Al-Imran:189-190)</h3>
				One of the distinct features of Islam is that it has left the conclusion of the facts upon mankind. Quran does not point you to a specific fact but mentions a bundle of facts for us to observe and conclude. Almost whole of the science is based on observations and conclusion. If you take these two things out, then there is nothing much left in Science. You observe, you test on a sample and move to a conclusion. For example, Newton’s Gravitational Law was observed on Earth, it was experimented on Moon’s, Earth’s and Sun’s movement and it was concluded to be applicable on all other celestial bodies. Same is the case with Newton’s Laws of Motions and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity. The only rule of doing observation and conclusions is based on one rule as described by Neil deGrasse Tyson i.e.
				<h3>“Follow the evidence wherever it Leads”</h3>

				</figure><br>
				Islam has provided the evidence and does not ask humans to blindly accept the existence of God but rather provides us the logic to accept it. If we observe the universe, we see it in perfect balanced shape. The Laws of Physics are followed so precisely that we can predict each and every movement of a celestial body. Even the place where current Laws do not hold apparently, there is still a balancing factor which does not let this universe go unstable. An example of this can be taken from total mass of the all the objects of Milky Way Galaxy and its speed. When scientists observed the speed of Milky Way and summed up the mass of all objects, they reached to a contradiction point with Laws of Physics. They found that speed of Milky Way Galaxy should have been faster than it is given current mass of all objects in the galaxy. When they calculated the real mass of the Milky Way given its speed through Laws of Physics, they found out that actual mass of our galaxy was much greater than sum of mass of all the objects in it. This led to discovery of Dark Matter; a form of matter which can not be seen but can only be observed through its effects which in this case was slowing speed of our galaxy. There is such a precision in the laws of nature that humans have not been able to understand it completely. This universe would have been much simple if it was made of only one type of bodies i.e. either all stars or all planets. But this universe is cocktail of Planets, Stars, Black Holes, Dark Matter, Clouds and Dust which makes it very complex but still it is balanced. Quran has defined this discipline of celestial bodies as 
				<h3>It is He who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; each floating in an orbit. (al-Anbiya:33)
				The sun and the moon move according to plan. (ar-Rahman:5)</h3>
				<image src="https://media.giphy.com/media/FsTRLi4SnM86Y/giphy.gif" width="50%" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded mx-auto d-block" allowFullScreen></image><br>
				<h3>And the sky, He raised; and He set up the balance. (ar-Rahman:7)</h3>
				To conclude that such a regulated and balanced setup came into being accidently is simply illogical. To build a simple building, structural engineers have to go through a lot of calculations so that the building is stable and shock proof. When NASA has to send a mission to the Moon or to the Mars, it has to plan and prepare for hundreds or thousands of factors and have to go through millions or billions of calculations so that their mission reached its position safe and sound. A universe which is literally infinitely complex than these operations can not remain stable and surviving for Billions of years without a glitch without a proper planning. In this case evidence leads us to the conclusion that there has to be a planning behind operations of the universe and for there to be planning, there has to be a planner. Hence Allah says in Quran 
				<h3>“But Allah is the Best Planner” (al-Imran:54)</h3>
				The most brilliant scientist of today’s time, Neil deGrasse Tyson says that <em>“Universe is under no obligation to make sense to us”</em>, then how come the Creator of this universe is under any such obligation. Just to deny the God because we can’t understand Him is absurd. But we choose to say “Mother Nature is best planner” but we don’t accept that it is not the Nature, it’s someone else who plans. It is also described in Quran in the following words
				<h3>Among them are those who listen to you; but We place covers over their hearts, to prevent them from understanding it, and heaviness in their ears. Even if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. Until, when they come to you, to argue with you, those who disbelieve will say, “These are nothing but myths of the ancients.” (Al-Anam:25)</h3>
				There is another wisdom behind using the words <em>“there are signs for those….”</em> In Quran. It is because we are encouraged to do research and explore the universe. Islam has encouraged us to observe this universe so that we may witness its vastness, its regularity, its perfection. Islam says that “to ponder upon this universe and its creation for a moment is better than worship of a thousand years”. But today’s Muslims are doing same mistakes that were done by Europeans in medieval era. Our youth is convinced that Islam and Science are two different things, Science and Religion can not go hand in hand and biggest cause of this mentality is lack of research in Muslim countries. Spinoza was convinced that his religion and science can not go together and it led to extreme distancing of today’s Europe from religion. Islam is the most scientific and logical religion in the world today unless you have not studied it enough yourself. If we keep ignoring the logical and scientific aspect of Islam due to lack of research and study, we might reach a stage with religion at which Western society is standing today.<br><br>
				<h3>Allah is He who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see, and then settled on the Throne. And He regulated the sun and the moon, each running for a specified period. He manages all affairs, and He explains the signs, that you may be certain of the meeting with your Lord. And it is He who spread the earth, and placed in it mountains and rivers. And He placed in it two kinds of every fruit. He causes the night to overlap the day. In that are signs for people who reflect. On earth are adjacent terrains, and gardens of vines, and crops, and date-palms, from the same root or from distinct roots, irrigated with the same water. We make some taste better than others. In that are proofs for people who reason. (ar-Ra’d:2-4)</h3>
