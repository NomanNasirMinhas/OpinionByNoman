				You might have come across many people who are going through hard times. They are physically and financially strong in most cases but still they are mentally very upset. This mental stress renders all other joys and positive aspects of life useless. When you try to help them, they might look convinced for the time being, but when you meet them again, they are in the same condition. You might have experienced same conditions that someone or you yourself might be passing through an issue which is very hard to overcome. And there comes a point where we give up on ourselves and can’t take it anymore. This is the moment we either overestimate the situation or underestimated our self. There is literally not a single stress which is beyond our limit. Every limit that exists is just in our imagination. It is not a pain or issue that is strong enough to control is rather it is just our mind that lets that pain to control us. Our mind intentionally or unintentionally creates a mirage that shows us pain in such a strong image that we lose the will to tackle it. 
				<br><br><h3>"If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your own estimate of it and this you have the power to revoke at any time” (Marcus Aurelius) <br></h3>
				We are just in pain because we have allowed that pain to be around us. Nothing in this world has caused much trouble than caused by imaginations and misconceptions. Instead of living in the real world, we use our imaginations to create a world of our own. This imaginative world has all those things, which we don’t have in real world. We prefer to live in imagination than to accept reality. This denial of reality and failure to accept reality causes a clash between real world and our imaginative world. This clash of two worlds causes most discomfort specially in young generation.  
				How we define pain and pleasure determines the extent of happiness and satisfaction in our life. Every action we perform is motivated by our will to get pleasure or to avoid pain. Not even a single conscious action is beyond this motivation. We create an association of events around us with either pleasure or pain. We develop this association of pain and pleasure as we grow up. This association is inculcated into us unconsciously through behavior of parents, family and society and our reaction those behaviors. This set of behavior and reaction of initial years of a child determines his most beliefs which would persist his entire life. These beliefs are mostly generic and specify our behavior in specific scenarios. That is how we determine an event to be pleasant or painful. For example, a person belonging to poor background can sleep easily without a fan in his room. But a person belonging to elite would feel very uncomfortable in the same room. Hence it is not a situation that is painful or pleasant it is our definition of pain and pleasure.
				<br><br><h3> "If we link massive pain to any behavior or emotional pattern, we will simply avoid indulging in it at all cost. We can use this understanding to harness the force of pain and pleasure to change virtually anything in our lives” (Anthony Robbins) <br></h3>
				<br>
				Pain and Pleasure are two emotional states of human which lay the foundation of either prosperity or destruction of human personality as well as human civilization. Motivation behind discovery of Aspirin was body pain which motivated human to find something that would heal them. Fear of getting failed motivates a student to study. Shame of being discriminated motivated Martin Luther King to stand up again white supremist. Feeling of 2nd class citizen motivated Feminism movements to stand up for women rights. Limits of the sky motivated human to land on the moon. If leaders of these achievement would have indulged themselves into despair and hopelessness, then the world might not have been like it is today. Pains and fears are like thunder lightnings in a dark night. Instead of learning from fears, if we decide to indulge ourselves in those fear and pains, there would be no way forward for us. Similarly, if we indulge too much in pleasures and stop moving to innovations and improvements this would again lead to moral and social corruption in society. This is the reason that Islam has ordered us to remember Allah in the times of both prosperity and calamity.
				<br><br><h3>They said, "We bring you good news in truth, so do not despair.” He said, “And who despairs of his Lord’s mercy but the lost?” (Al-Hijr:55,56) <br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>"And when your Lord proclaimed: “If you give thanks, I will grant you increase; but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is severe. And Moses said, “Even if you are ungrateful, together with everyone on earth—Allah is in no need, Worthy of Praise.” (Abraham:7,8) <br></h3>
				Allah does not ask us to be grateful for Himself, but he has ordered us to be grateful so that we may remember that our success or pleasure is not ultimate and would remain for as long as Allah has granted him. This restraints human to their defined limits and not to transgress them. Similarly, Allah has ordered us to remember him in the time of disparity so that we may remember that this calamity or pain is also not permanent and would remain as long as Allah wills so. This provides us an array of hope and helps us to remain optimists and motivated. It is paramount for us to understand and believe that whether pain or pleasure is never permanent. It is the law of nature. The earth we are living is itself not forever then how can pain and pleasure within its dimensions can be forever. All of the matters happening in the dimensions of earth are bounded by its characteristics. That’s why Allah has stated multiple time that Heaven and Hell are forever. Hence it is only after judgment day that any Pain or Pleasure will endure forever. 
				<br><br><h3>"But the Messenger and those who believe with him struggle with their possessions and their lives. These have deserved the good things. These are the successful. Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great victory." (at-Tawbah:88,89)<br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>“But as for those who reject Our revelations, and are too proud to accept them—these are the inmates of the Fire, where they will remain forever.” (Al-Araf 36) <br></h3>
				According to a report in 2018 by World Health Organization, 
				<br><br><i>"Close to 800 000 people die due to suicide every year. For every suicide there are many more people who attempt suicide every year. A prior suicide attempt is the single most important risk factor for suicide in the general population. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15–29-year-old. 79% of global suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. While the link between suicide and mental disorders (in particular, depression and alcohol use disorders) is well established in high-income countries, many suicides happen impulsively in moments of crisis with a breakdown in the ability to deal with life stresses, such as financial problems, relationship break-up or chronic pain and illness. In addition, experiencing conflict, disaster, violence, abuse, or loss and a sense of isolation are strongly associated with suicidal behavior. Globally, more than 300 million people of all ages suffer from depression. Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and is a major contributor to the overall global burden of disease.”</i> <br><br>
				These statistics outline some of the most striking factors of human nature. Primary reason behind suicides is depression. Suicide is second leading cause of death among 15-29 years old persons. At this stage of life, Financial stress is not up-to that level which could be associated with suicide. Real cause of these emotional breakdowns is that we have not understood our own worth yet in this stage of life. Importance of Wealth, Job, House, Car or Someone’s attention cannot be denied in one’s life but do these things worth more than you? If you don’t get these things in initial stages of life, do you think that it will also never come to you rest of your life? The day we value other things more than our own is the day we lose our ultimate success. Because every human is the best creation of Allah. When you value money or other materialistic thing over this best creation you are indirectly insulting the creation of Allah. When you have a private aero plane, you don’t care whether you have a bicycle or lose it. You, yourself are like an aero-plane so act like one. And a plane is useless unless it does not have its engine and your engine is believe in Allah. The day we lose believe in Allah is the day we lose our power and start disintegrating just like an aero-plane which would rot while standing on runway, if you take out its engine. 
				<br><br><h3>"O my sons, go and inquire about Joseph and his brother, and do not despair of Allah's comfort. None despairs of Allah's comfort except the disbelieving people.” (Yusuf: 87) <br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>"So, wait patiently for the Decision of your Lord, and do not be like the Fellow of the Fish who cried out in despair.” (al-Qalam:48) <br></h3>
				We need to decide our standards and we need to decide when to say “no more”. What makes people great and successful is their high standards and their firm believe on them. This firm believe is the only motivation behind their continuous struggle despite of all opposing factors. Whenever we narrate story of a great personality to common people, they normally reply that these are fictional stories or one-out-of-million have such fortune. We need to understand that it was not the fortune of the person which was one-out-of-million, it was his will and decision which was one-out-of-million. Every person has the ability to take such a decision because it is free of cost and within your own control. It is me and you, who must decide when to take such a decision. And the reason why such a decision is one-out-of-million is because millions of decisions are made by people every day but very few has the believe to stick to it till its end. A million miles journey starts with a first step and it is the first step which is harder to take: which is decision. 
				<br><br><h3>"Allah gives firmness to those who believe, with the firm word, in this life, and in the Hereafter. And Allah leads the wicked astray. Allah does whatever He wills.” (Ibrahim:27) <br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>"And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not dispute, lest you falter and lose your courage. And be steadfast. Allah is with the steadfast.” (al-Anfal:46) <br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>"But those who were given knowledge said, “Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds.” Yet none attains it except the steadfast.” (al-Qasas: 80) <br></h3>
				Keep in mind that in Surah Anfal, Allah has stated that 
				<br><br><h3>"O prophet! Rouse the believers to battle. If there are twenty steadfast among you, they will defeat two hundred; and if there are a hundred of you, they will defeat a thousand of those who disbelieve; because they are a people who do not understand.” (al-Anfal) <br></h3>
				Allah has not used the word of “Worshipper” or word of “Pious” but Allah has used the word of “Steadfast”. Hence it is the steadfastness which gives you edge over a calamity. Have you ever wondered, why Allah has ordered “remember Allah continuously” in good and hard times? Because this continuous remembering gives us strength of steadfastness. Companions of the Prophets used to recite different Quranic and Arabic verses while in a battle, in which they called Allah for help. This help was not help of large number of Army or the help of Angels, but it was help of steadfastness which awarded them victory. Holy Prophet PBUH preached Islam for around 23 years and he faced more difficulties than any other Prophet, but still he never asked Allah to ease his situation rather he asked Allah to give him courage and steadfastness. Do we think that problems of our lives are bigger than those of Holy Prophet which cannot be solved by help of Allah or Do we think that (Allah Forbid) help of Allah is not strong enough to ease our problems? Whether we accept it or not, whenever we behave desperate or depressed, how strongly we may reject verbally but we are practically implying one or both of these statements. We think ourselves too weak to ask from Allah and simultaneously we also complain to Him for this pain.
				<br><br><h3>"And when a calamity befell you, even after you had inflicted twice as much, you said, “How is this?” Say, “It is from your own selves.” Allah is Able to do all things.” (Aal-e-Imran:165) <br></h3>
				Have we ever thought on the point that why Allah say in Quran that 
				<br><br><h3>"O you who believe! Seek help through patience and prayers. Allah is with the steadfast.” (al-Baqarah:153) <br></h3>
				Allah is neither desperate for our prayers nor our prayers have such value which could be as per His status. Allah wants us to pray so that we keep getting motivation for our struggle. What we need to understand is that The Road to Success passes through the valleys of pains on vehicle of firm belief of success with fuel of steadfastness. The moment we lose our believe and stop struggling is the moment we stop our journey to success and get stuck on the road surrounded by valleys of pain. If we want to get out of these valleys of pain, we must continue our journey with believe.
