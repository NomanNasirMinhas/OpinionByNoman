				<em>Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018)</em> was an English theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at the University of Cambridge at the time of his death. He was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge between 1979 and 2009. He is considered as one of the most brilliant minds in the history of mankind. As reported by Jamie Ducharme in an article on March 14, 2018 in <em>Times</em><br><br>
				<i>"I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail,"</i> he (Stephen Hawking) told the Guardian. <i>"There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark."</i><i>"God is the name people give to the reason we are here,"</i> he (Stephen Hawking) said. <i>"But I think that reason is the laws of physics rather than someone with whom one can have a personal relationship. An impersonal God."</i><br><br>
				
				In his book <em>"Brief Answers to Big Questions"</em> Stephen Hawking writes at different spots that
				<br><br><i>"I think the universe was spontaneously created out of nothing, according to the laws of science"<br>
				"If you accept, as I do, that the laws of nature are fixed, then it doesn't take long to ask: What role is there for God?"<br>
				"If you like, you can say the laws are the work of God, but that is more a definition of God than a proof of his existence"<br>
				"Did God create the quantum laws that allowed the Big Bang to occur? I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science has a more compelling explanation than a divine creator."<br>
				"The universe itself, in all its mind-boggling vastness and complexity, could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature"<br>
				""there was no time before the Big Bang."<br> 
				"We have Finally found something that doesn’t have a cause, because there was no time for a cause to exist in, for me this means that there is no possibility of a creator, because there is no time for a creator to have existed in."<br>
				"We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful."</i><br><br>
				<img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/afs-prod/media/media:734340262cd444d88521058466cd0f80/3000.jpeg"><br>

				Stephen Hawking, without any doubt, was a great scientist to whom science and humans owe a lot. But why Stephen never believed in the existence of a Creator? <em>Wasn’t he smart enough or was he smart enough?</em> If a man with that much knowledge and vision did not believed in a Creator, then how a man with simple mind can be convinced to believe in a Creator of this universe? Well to answer all these questions, let’s start with a theoretical or philosophical argument and move to a more mathematical reasonings.<br><br>
				First of all, let’s take a glimpse on what Islam has to say about creation of universe and existence of <em>ALLAH</em> and then move further,<br><br>
				<h3>"It is narrated on the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of <em>ALLAH</em> (Peace be upon him) said: Men will continue to question one another till this is propounded: <em>ALLAH</em> created all things but who created <em>ALLAH</em>? He who found himself confronted with such a situation should say: I affirm my faith in <em>ALLAH</em>." (Sahih Muslim Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 242)</h3><br>

				<h3>"Messenger of <em>ALLAH</em> may peace be upon him) observed: The Satan comes to everyone. of you and says: Who created this and that? till he questions: Who created your Lord? When he comes to that, one should seek refuge in <em>ALLAH</em> and keep away (from such idle thoughts)." (Sahih Muslim Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 244)</h3><br>
				So why the <em>Prophet PBUH</em> directed to seek refuge in <em>ALLAH</em> when asked such questions. Let’s start with a simple example. One day I was sitting with my grandfather watching a documentary about <em>Neil Armstrong’s landing on the moon</em>. My grandfather could not understand what it was so he asked me what were they telling in the documentary. I answered in layman’s wording that they are telling how a man landed on the moon. He gave a laughter and said in Punjabi "<em>What type foolish idea are you listening.</em> How is it possible that a man can travel to moon? They are just making you fool." I tried to convince him with best of my knowledge but he stuck to his point, so finally I gave up. The reason behind why I was not able to convince him was that there was a large gap between his knowledge of science and contemporary developments of science. Move just 2 centuries back in time and consider yourself telling a person writing a letter to his friend in another city that "Why are you writing a letter to your friend. Why can’t you just WhatsApp him?" It might sound funny but you would end up in a mental hospital either while trying to convince him or due to being considered already insane. Now move a bit back and give same advice to a person living in civilization of Greeks, Romans, Mesopotamia, Egypt or Indus. You can’t convince about existence of WhatsApp (which a 4-year-old child uses today) to Aristotle or Socrates which were considered most brilliant minds of their time. <em>Just by giving a gap of around 2000-2500 years, you can’t explain the simplest phenomenon of today’s world to the most brilliant minds of history.</em> It is because we are 2000 years ahead of time, so how can we be convinced with mere logic or knowledge that <em>ALLAH</em> has such and such brilliant attributes. This is where believe steps in. Now consider that Aristotle was somehow brought in today’s world and he was shown and given the "privilege" to use WhatsApp and send him back to his time. When he would tell his students about this "unbelievable" invention, some of his students would call Aristotle either lair or either insane. But there would be some students who would believe that a technology like WhatsApp is possible, not on the basis of logic or science but on the basis of believe which they would have in Aristotle. Aristotle might spend his entire life his students convincing them just on the basis of logic, but would fail. Same students would be convinced immediately, if they believed that Aristotle is speaking truth. So, some phenomenon need believe a lot more than evidence to be convinced. Hence it is said that say <em>"I affirm my faith in <em>ALLAH</em>"</em> in such situations. This example would be cleared by explaining the Miraj of the <em>Prophet PBUH</em>. On the night of <em>27th Shaban</em> (Islamic Month), <em>ALLAH</em> Almighty called his final <em>Prophet PBUH</em> to the Heavens. <em>Prophet PBUH</em> first travelled from Makkah to Jerusalem with Hazrat Jibraeel (Gabriel) to lead prayer of all Prophets in al-Aqsa Mosque. Then he ascended to the heavens first on Burraq with Hazrat Jibraeel to a place called Sidra-tul-Muntaha’a then alone to the Arsh to meet <em>ALLAH</em>. This was a physical journey and was covered and completed within the same night (further discussion on it would be carried in a separate chapter). After returning back same night, Holy <em>Prophet PBUH</em> told the habitants of Makkah about his journey last night and he got same reaction to Aristotle’s students. [At that time, the time to travel between Makkah and Madina (about 450 Km) at that time was about 8 days (which is now about 2 and half hours on train).] Even if the <em>Prophet PBUH</em> would have told them today’s required time to travel between Makkah and Madina, he would have faced same reaction. They called him lair and insane. Some of them came to the best friend the <em>Prophet PBUH</em> i.e. Hazrat Abu-Bakar (R.A) and told him that "Do you know what <em>Muhammad (PBUH)</em> is telling to the people of Makkah? He is saying that he has traveled to heavens last night and has returned within the same night". Hazrat Abu-Bakar (RA) replied without any pause that "If the <em>Prophet PBUH</em> has said this from his tongue then it would have been so, undoubtedly". <em>ALLAH</em> says in Quran
				<br><br><h3>"He saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord" (an-Najm: 18)</h3><br>
				Just like we built an analogy of showing WhatsApp to Aristotle, <em>ALLAH</em> called the <em>Prophet PBUH</em> to show some of the Great Signs and when he returned to tell the inhabitants of Makkah what he saw, some believed him due to his 40 years pre-prophethood character of truthfulness and honesty, while others rejected him on the grounds of logic and knowledge, similar to our analogy. Islam asks us to believe in <em>ALLAH</em> on the basis of believe not on the basis of our logic and knowledge, because we are far beyond the time. Even if none of the Aristotle’s students had believed him, still they cannot be called right. Their denial cannot mean that technology cannot advance to current extent. Similarly, even if none had believed the <em>Prophet PBUH</em> then existence of <em>ALLAH</em> cannot be denied. <em>ALLAH</em> says in Quran
				<br><br><h3>"That is some of the wisdom your Lord has revealed to you" (al-Isr’a: 39)</h3><br>
				This verse would be clearer soon. But before that, Let’s take another theoretical discussion built on scientific grounds. Idea of a body like <em>Black-Hole was first proposed by John Michell in 1784</em>. This idea was damped when wave-like nature of light was discovered in 19th century. In early 20th century <em>Albert Einstein proposed theory of general relativity</em> and hence discussion of black hole was once again started. Many scientists started their research. This discussion became the main subject of the research. Primary problem while this research was that black hole were invisible and could only be detected or felt on the basis of their gravitational effect on their surroundings. Practically Black Holes were invisible but their existence was strongly believed. On 10 April,2019 first ever image of a Black Hole was released which was captured by Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) after 2 years of data collection. Black Hole was still invisible in this picture. It was recognized by gases at the edge of the Black Holes before getting trapped into Black Hole. Question arises that if a person needs to see a thing in order to believe it how would you show something "invisible" and "un-observable" to him. How would you make him believe that Black Hole does actually exists? How can a scientist believe in Black Hole which is "invisible"? Same scientist would ask God to be seen in order to believe in Him, but would believe in Black Hole without even seeing it.<br>
				<img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail rounded mx-auto d-block" style="width: 50%" src="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/thumbnails/image/blackhole.png?itok=THJrwcHP"><br> 
				Here two points are to pondered upon. First, that if something is not observable does not prove non-existence of that thing. You can feel it by its signs just like scientists felt Black Holes through its effects. Question arises that how can we observe or feel <em>ALLAH</em>? Before answering that, lets study how Neptune was discovered. It was mathematically predicted before it was observed. It was predicted by many astronomers independently in 1846. They noticed discrepancies in Uranus’s observed position in contrast to its predicted position. Uranus was not exactly was it had to be mathematically. This led scientists to conclude that there must be a large size planet behind Uranus which was causing this anomaly. So how to feel presence of <em>ALLAH</em>? <em>ALLAH</em> also shows us His signs through which we can feel his presence. Islam is not an irrational religion. It understands and addresses concerns of human psychology. Quran has stated at many places about His signs. For example, just like we predicted Neptune on the basis of a pattern, <em>ALLAH</em> points a pattern of creation so that we may understand that there is someone to create this pattern
				<br><br><h3>"Have they not seen how <em>ALLAH</em> originates the creation, and then reproduces it? This is easy for <em>ALLAH</em>. Say, "Roam the earth, and observe how He originated the creation." Then <em>ALLAH</em> will bring about the next existence. <em>ALLAH</em> has power over all things." (al-Ankaboot:19-20)<br></h3>
				Holy <em>Prophet PBUH</em> did not know how to read and write, but still he recited Quran which not only told about the earlier Prophets but also described many medical, scientific and astronomical phenomenon. A person without education cannot state such precise facts by himself, which means that Quran was not his word but it was the word of <em>ALLAH</em>.
				<br><br><h3>"You did not read any scripture before this, nor did you write it down with your right hand; otherwise the falsifiers would have doubted. In fact, it is clear signs in the hearts of those given knowledge. No one renounce Our signs except the unjust" (al-Ankaboot:48-49)<br></h3>
				Before this universe there was not time so He created time
				<br><br><h3>"Do they not see that We made the night for them to rest therein, and the day for visibility? Surely in that are signs for people who believe." (an-Namal: 86)<br><h3>
				<em>ALLAH</em> then describes creation and nature of both universe and human so that we can identify the perfection of his creation which cannot be without any Prefect Creator
				<br><br><h3>"He brings the living out of the dead, and He brings the dead out of the living, and He revives the land after it had died. Likewise, you will be resurrected. And of His signs is that He created you from dust; and behold, you become humans spreading out. And of His signs is that He created for you mates from among yourselves, so that you may find tranquility in them; and He planted love and compassion between you. In this are signs for people who reflect. And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your languages and colors. In this are signs for those who know. And of His signs are your sleep by night and day, and your pursuit of His bounty. In this are signs for people who listen. And of His signs is that He shows you the lightning, causing fear and hope. And He brings down water from the sky, and with it He revives the earth after it was dead. In this are signs for people who understand. And of His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand at His disposal. And then, when He calls you out of the earth, you will emerge at once." (ar-Rum: 19-25)<br></h3>
				Likewise, many other signs are described by <em>ALLAH</em> in Quran which reflect presence of an Almighty who was behind these creations, phenomenon and behaviors. One may ask, what’s so great in that as we human also can create things. First of all, it is from the very minute wisdom and knowledge provided to by <em>ALLAH</em> through which we are creating impressive technological advancement. We cannot call it a creation. We can call it only production as everything we make, we produce it through already existing matter. But the creation of <em>ALLAH</em> does not need something. <em>He says "Be" and "It is".</em> But difference between <em>ALLAH</em>’s creation and our Production is that <em>ALLAH</em> has created this universe and everything in it with a perfect calculation and in a balance. It is a scientific fact that everything that we human make has a negative impact on the environment. That’s the rule of Entropy in Thermodynamics. We, humans, cannot create something without destroying the other thing. Whenever we do a work in real world, we release an unused amount of thermal energy into surroundings which has disturbed the Thermodynamic balance of our environment. When human cannot create a single thing without creating a backfire effect, how can one imagine rationally that this entire universe came into existence with such a perfect calculation without any creator.<br>
				The other point to be noted from discovery of Black Holes is that scales and standards of the world are not enough to measure and quantify everything. Before Black Holes, we called something to exist only if we could observe it directly. We see everything around us because it emits a light within visible spectrum which our naked eye can observe. Then there are some lights which cannot be observed with naked eye but can be detected through scientific equipment like Infrared rays, X-Rays, Ultraviolet Rays etc. Similarly, there are sounds within an audible frequency range 20Hz-20,000Hz which we can hear with our ears. But there are many other sounds which we can detect other sounds which we can’t hear without special equipment e.g. ultrasounds. So before Black Holes, human presumed that we have ability to observe everything directly. But Black Holes existence proved that for something to exist, it is not essential to emit light or sound. There might be many more assumptions which we might consider as standard but it would be wrong. Similarly, we have a pre-built notion in our minds about how someone should look like. Same question is asked by many non-Muslims and might arise in minds of Muslims that How <em>ALLAH</em> might look like. Before answering that, let’s see how we describe someone’s appearance in our world. We normally describe living beings to have ears, eyes, hands, legs (or something to move), tongue, heart, brain, a skeletal/bones/muscle system etc. Normally when someone is asking about how <em>ALLAH</em> looks like, it is just like trying to see Black Hole with naked eye. These parameters are defined by <em>ALLAH</em> Himself for his creatures and cannot be defined same for the Creator of these attributes. To understand this, take example of Artificial Intelligence in today’s world. Human have produced robots with exact copy of human abilities. These robots can think rationally and can do all work as by humans. We cannot expect robots to ask humans to have microchips, wires, metallic body, electrical circuits, programmed algorithms like them. A human cannot be described through attributes of a robot, while a robot can have some of the attributes of human. Similarly, <em>ALLAH</em> cannot be described using attributes of human or creatures of this universe. Whatever <em>ALLAH</em> might look like cannot be comprehended at this stage and why we cannot we comprehended Him is because far behind time to understand it. Hence <em>ALLAH</em> has asked us to wait  
				<br><br><h3>"The human being was created of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not seek to rush Me." (al-Anbiya:37)<br></h3>
				Let’s create a more mathematical evaluation of human capacity to understand <em>ALLAH</em>’s existence. Suppose you are student of Play Group and you are explained the science of College level, will you be able to get it completely? No, you will need to get knowledge of science between Play Group to Secondary Level first in order to comprehend science subjects of College level. <em>ALLAH</em> says
				<br><br><h3>"To <em>ALLAH</em> belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth." (an-Najm:31)<br></h3>
				Although modern science strongly believes that there is a high possibility of many other universes like us, but for the time being let’s assume that there is just one Universe and donate all of information about it with x.<br>
				<em>Step 1:</em> According to an article written by Clara Moskowitz on May 12, 2011,<br>
				<i>"All the stars, planets and galaxies that can be seen today make up just 4 percent of the universe. The other 96 percent is made of stuff astronomers can't see, detect or even comprehend……... Overall, dark energy is thought to contribute 73 percent of all the mass and energy in the universe. Another 23 percent is dark matter, which leaves only 4 percent of the universe composed of regular matter, such as stars, planets and people."</i><br>
				It means that Humans can have maximum 4% knowledge of the entire universe at this stage.
				So, knowledge of human at "this step" (denoted by y) becomes equal to 4% of Knowledge of Universe.<br><br>

				<em>Step 2:</em> Radius of this observable universe is estimated to be 46.6 Billion light years but farthest object yet detected by humans is Galaxy MACS0647-JD which is 13.3 Billion Light years from earth. Hence Human have yet discovered just 28.7% of estimated observable universe, hence y become reduced by 72.3%
				<h3>y=0.01x</h3>
				<em>Step 3:</em> According to an article written by Matt Williams in Universe Today<br>
				<i>"We are immediately aware of the three dimensions that surround us on a daily basis – those that define the length, width, and depth of all objects in our universes (the x, y, and z axes, respectively). Beyond these three visible dimensions, scientists believe that there may be many more. In fact, the theoretical framework of Superstring Theory posits that the universe exists in ten different dimensions. These different aspects are what govern the universe, the fundamental forces of nature, and all the elementary particles contained within."</i><br>
				He states 10 dimensions of universe as<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Length</li>
					<li>Width</li>
					<li>Depth/Height</li>
					<li>Time</li>
					<li>In fifth dimension, we would see a world slightly different from our own that would give us a means of measuring the similarity and differences between our world and other possible ones.</li>
					<li>In the sixth, we would see a plane of possible worlds, where we could compare and position all the possible universes that start with the same initial conditions as this one.</li>
					<li>In seventh dimension, you have access to the possible worlds that start with different initial conditions.</li>
					<li>The eighth dimension again gives us a plane of such possible universe histories, each of which begins with different initial conditions and branches out infinitely (hence why they are called infinities).</li>
					<li>In the ninth dimension, we can compare all the possible universe histories, starting with all the different possible laws of physics and initial conditions.</li>
					<li>In the tenth and final dimension, we arrive at the point in which everything possible and imaginable is covered.</li>
				</ol> <br>

				These are just 10 dimensions yet discovered, but let’s assume that these are the only dimensions in this universe. So far law of science can describe only first 3 dimensions (Time has not yet been comprehended in law of physics). It means that it further reduces human knowledge of universe by at-least 67%. Hence y becomes<br>
				<h3>y=0.003x</h3>
				At this point we are considering a human with knowledge of 13.8 billion years with perfect calculations and comprehension of each and every object in this universe. Still knowledge of such super-human is about 0.3% of this Universe. Let’s stop here for a while and move to another dimension. Although there are many other factors that further constraint human knowledge like psychology, religious believes, personal wishes, illusions etc. But we won’t into details of those here.<br><br>
				<em>Step 4:</em> From here on, we can divide human knowledge in 2 parts. One knowledge which is authentic and noted while other part of knowledge is which we have built through assumptions. First speaking Homo Sapiens appeared on the face of earth about 50,000 years ago. Human started to read and write about 5,000 years ago. It means that any authentic document which we can have will not be older than 5000 years. While the age of this universe is estimated to be 13.8 Billion Years. It means that law of science has no documented proof of what happened on earth or in universe before 5000 years. So, our 2 parts of knowledge have ratio of<br><br>
				<h3>Documented Knowledge = 5000 years<br>Assumed Knowledge = 13,799,995,000 years</h3><br>
				If we calculate this ratio then it come out that only 0.000036% of our knowledge of this universe is Documented (not authentic). If we assume all this knowledge to be true (which mostly is not), then knowledge of humans become<br><br>
				<h3>y=0.003x ×0.000036%=0.0000001x</h3><br>
				So "up-to here", a human possessing all the documented knowledge of human history with perfect authenticity has 1/10000000 part of Universe’s Knowledge. Let’s not forget that we up-till here, we have assumed that there is only one universe, and a human has the knowledge of entire history of the world and of all branches of knowledge including science (with 5 main branches), religions (roughly 4200), arts (4 major categories), philosophy (traditionally 5 main branches).<br>
				We have considered a super intellectual human which have a lot more knowledge than any anybody ever existed on face of this earth, still his knowledge about this Universe is less than one to ten billionth part. 
				Human’s quantifying ability is restricted by time and space. Everything created in this universe occupies certain amount of space and lives for a certain amount of time. Space and Time were created when this universe was created. Before that there was no space and no time. When Space and Time vanish, then things become limitless and unbounded. At that point number become meaningless. Science has not yet been able to understand what would happen if Space and Time cease to exist. This is the main reason why Science has failed to understand and comprehend existence of <em>ALLAH</em>. Behind barrier of Space and Time, limits cease to exist. Hence <em>ALLAH</em> says in Quran
				<br><br><h3>"They said, "Glory be to You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. It is you who are the Knowledgeable, the Wise." (al-Baqarah: 32)<br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>"On the Day when <em>ALLAH</em> will gather the messengers, then say, "What response were you given?" They will say, "We have no knowledge; it is you who are the Knower of the unseen." (al-An’am: 109)<br></h3>
				<br><br><h3>"And they say, "Had the Most Gracious willed, we would not have worshiped them. (other Gods)" But they have no knowledge of that; they are merely guessing." (az-Zukhruf: 20)<br><br></h3>
