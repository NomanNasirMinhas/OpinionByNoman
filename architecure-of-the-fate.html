          	Every human being has a question in his mind at one or other phase of his life? “If everything has been written in my fate, Why do I need to strive?”. If we turn this question in religious context then, almost every Muslim (as well as Non-Muslim) has question in his mind that “If Allah knows our end, Why Allah has sent us to this earth and tests us to choose between right and wrong?” In Quran Allah says
              <h3>"We created man from a liquid mixture, to test him; and We made him hearing and seeing."
              <br>(al-Insan 2)</h3>
              <h3>“Have the people supposed that they will be left alone to say, “We believe,” without being put to the test? We have tested those before them. Allah will surely know the truthful, and He will surely know the liars.
              <br>(Al-Ankaboot 2-3)”</h3>

              <h3>“There and then the believers were tested, and were shaken most severely. When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is sickness said, “Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but illusion.” And when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib, you cannot make a stand, so retreat.” And a faction of them asked the Prophet to excuse them, saying, “Our homes are exposed,” although they were not exposed. They only wanted to flee.”
              <br>(Al-Ahzab 11-13)</h3>
              Once, a friend of mine asked me a question. He said that love of Allah for us is more than that of 70 mothers combined, then why does He tests us. Why can’t he just give us what we ask from him? Same question may pass through many minds in form or another. Allah has the power to do anything on just ordering “Kunn”, then why does He makes us to wait or does not provide us what we pray? This question has a very simple answer. When we used  to be a child and we tried to do something which might harm us like playing with knife, going near fire etc, then our mother did not allowed to do that. We used to insist but still our mother didn’t allow us just for our own good. Same is the case with our prayers. What are we wishing might not be in our favor or Allah might have much better plan for us. Now, when we say this phrase, normally people don’t understand importance of this phrase. Reason is that we have not believed Allah to that extent. When Allah says in Quran that<br>
              <h3>“Allah is the best Planner”?</h3>
              We don’t believe from heart that He really is the best planner. We think that what we have planned is still better, and  in other sense we are implying through our actions that <br>(God Forbid) we are better planner than Allah. Reason why Allah is the best planner is that human decisions are distorted by emotions, imaginations, biasness, selfishness, delusions and by fog of time and knowledge. <br>
              <h3>“Men as well as women are much oftener led by
              Their hearts than by their understandings”<br>(Lord Chesterfield)</h3>
              Allah is free from all these distortions. He has absolute Knowledge of infinite time. We through childness of our imaginations, deny Allah of this capacity. Most of discomfort in our lives is caused by this childness. We blame Allah for our shortcomings, but when Allah provides us with what we asked for, we do not give its due credit to Him. That’s why Allah has stated in Quran that<br>
              <h3>When adversity touches the human being, he calls on Us. But then, when We favor him with a blessing from Us, he says, “I have attained this by virtue of my knowledge.” However, it is a test, but most of them do not know.
              <br>(al-Zumar 49)</h3>
              The time we believe through actions in Allah, there would be no stress or discomfort. When Allah does not provide us with something, He simply is testing our faith. But why Allah needs to test us? Why can’t He grant us paradise without testing us even though we have proclaimed Islam? Again let’s  explore this answer through a worldly example. We interact with hundreds of people in daily life. We don’t call of these people our friend. We grade them between familiar, acquaintance, colleague, friend and best friend. Every person who claims to be your friend may not actually be your friend. True friends are revealed when they are tested through time. You observe their behaviors in easy and hard times and consistency in their behavior proves who is your friend and who is not. Similarly, a person who claims himself to be a Muslim, might not have the necessary belief in Allah. In fact most the Muslims today don’t possess  true believe in Allah. Hence to make a distinction between a Believer and Non-Believer, Allah tests us through easy and hard times. Again it is the consistency of behavior and attitude of a person which shows this distinction.<br> 
              <h3>We will certainly test you, until We know those among you who strive, and those who are steadfast, and We will test your reactions.
              <br>(Muhammad 31)</h3>
              <h3>Your possessions and your children are a test, but with Allah is a splendid reward.
              <br>(Al-Taghabun 15)</h3>
              <h3>We will certainly test you with some fear and hunger, and some loss of possessions and lives and crops. But give good news to the steadfast.
              <br>(al-Baqarah 155)</h3>
              We normally see calamities in a very narrow scope. We consider it a burden upon our souls. There is always a silver lightning in dark clouds. Let’s take a very simple example. A person who wants to improve his body muscles does hours of workouts in gym and follows a very strict diet with very painful routine. And he does not do it for a day or two. He continues it for months and years. It is then that he gains an appealing outlook. So if it takes such a long time to and consistent hard work to build our physical personality, how can one imagine to build a spiritually and psychologically strong personalities without facing similar hard time. It is simply irrational to think of attaining spiritual and psychological maturity and stability without doing any effort. All hard times in our life do same to us. Allah does not simply puts us in burdens to test us but also to strengthen us. Allah puts us in deep water, not to drown us but to clean us. We may come across hundreds of such international celebrities who have stated how their hard times made them realized their weaknesses and gave them a chance to correct them. Calamities are just like a flashlight which Allah throws on our weaknesses to make us realize about them. But unfortunately, instead of focusing on the spot where light is being thrown, we look directly to lights and hence we become unable to see anything. To put it in simple words, instead of focusing on our weaknesses and correcting them, we put all our focus on our miserable condition and put our mind into a state of despair. Hard times are probably the best chance to inculcate emotional stability, far sightedness, maturity, and consistency in a person. <br>
              <h3>Every soul will taste death. We burden you with adversity and prosperity—a test. And to Us you will be returned.
              <br>(al-Anbiya 35)</h3>
              <h3>He who created death and life—to test you—as to which of you is better in conduct. He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.
              <br>(al-Mulk 2)</h3>
              Allah tests us with our wealth, with our health, with our children, with our possessions, with our conduct. HE tests someone by giving him too much wealth and tests other by taking wealth from him. HE tests someone by blessing him good physical and mental health and tests other by poor health conditions and mental stress. Life is a Test composed of sets of tests of our daily life. All these tests are to create a harmony between words and actions of a person. A person may thank Allah by tongue but his actions may not be consistent with it. A person may pronounce Allah as Almighty through Kalma, but does he really believes in it?

              <h3>As for man, whenever his Lord tests him, and honors him, and prospers him, he says, “My Lord has honored me.” But whenever He tests him, and restricts his livelihood for him, he says, “My Lord has insulted me.”
              <br>(al-Fajr 15-16)</h3>
              These verses outline a very fundamental moral Faultline of human nature that he is pleased only with his own benefit. We define blessing as fulfilment of all of our wishes and declare it our insult when our wish is not answered. Although both decisions are made by Allah, but our nature creates a divide between these decisions according to our own wish-list. This Faultline outlines the importance of consistency in human behavior in our daily lives. A person who is psychologically strong will always adhere to his rules of life and will never go against them. On the other hand a person who is psychologically and emotionally weak will dwindle in his integrity when a situation comes up against his will. Consistency in behavior is biggest success of a human in his daily life. Whether it is a Muslim or Non-Muslim, as a human such persons always feels internal satisfaction.  
              <h3>Those who, when a calamity afflicts them, say, “To Allah we belong, and to Him we will return.”  Upon these are blessings and mercy from their Lord. These are the guided ones.
              <br>(al-Baqarah 156-157)</h3>
              Nature of human is like a dress made of silk while our wrong words and deeds are like cactus. Every wrong deed and world tears others dress making him ashamed and feel degraded.
              Allah puts us into test to make us realize our positions and value so that we may not over-estimate or under-estimate ourselves. When life goes too well, human starts to develop a sense of arrogance and greatness in his personality unconsciously or consciously. It is human nature. We start to believe in the superiority of our knowledge, virtues and powers. Hence these calamities and trials are to keep check upon our emotions of superiority. It makes us realize that there is someone much more powerful and superior to us. Humans have a very basic issue that he believes only what he experiences. You can advice a person thousand times about a issue but he wont be able to believe it from heart unless he experiences same matter. This is one of the biggest difference between enlightened and un-enlightened persons. So to make a person believe that he is not superior and his knowledge is very minute, he is put into a test.<br>
              <h3>When adversity touches the human being, he calls on Us. But then, when We favor him with a blessing from Us, he says, “I have attained this by virtue of my knowledge.” However, it is a test, but most of them do not know.
