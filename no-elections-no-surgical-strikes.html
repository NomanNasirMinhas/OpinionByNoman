			India inherited its border dispute with China from its British colonial rulers, who hosted a 1914 conference with the Tibetan and Chinese governments to set the border. Beijing has never recognized the 1914 boundary, known as the McMahon Line, and currently claims 90,000 square kilometers (34,750 square miles) of territory - nearly all of what constitutes India's Arunachal Pradesh state. The border dispute first flared up during a visit by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to Beijing in 1959. Nehru questioned the boundaries shown on official Chinese maps, prompting Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai to reply that his government did not accept the colonial frontier. Chinese troops poured over the disputed frontier with India in 1962 during a dispute over the border's demarcation. It sparked a four-week war that left thousands of dead on the Indian side before China's forces withdrew. Beijing retained Aksai Chin, a strategic corridor linking Tibet to western China. India still claims the entire Aksai Chin region as its own, as well as the nearby China-controlled Shaksgam valley in northern Kashmir. Another flashpoint was Nathu La, India's highest mountain pass in northeastern Sikkim state, which is sandwiched between Bhutan, Chinese-ruled Tibet and Nepal. During a series of clashes, including the exchange of artillery fire, New Delhi said some 80 Indian soldiers died and counted up to 400 Chinese casualties. This skirmish was the last time shots were officially reported to have been fired across the disputed border. Four Indian soldiers were ambushed and killed along the dividing line in Arunachal Pradesh. New Delhi blamed Beijing for crossing into the Indian territory, a claim dismissed by China. India and China had a months-long high-altitude standoff in Bhutan's Doklam region after the Indian army sent troops to stop China constructing a road in the area. The Doklam plateau is strategically significant as it gives China access to the so-called "chicken's neck" - a thin strip of land connecting India's northeastern states with the rest of the country. It is claimed by both China and Bhutan, an ally of India. The issue was resolved after talks. India on Tuesday said 20 of its soldiers were killed after a violent clash with Chinese forces a day earlier in the strategically important Galwan Valley on the Himalayan frontier, a dramatic escalation that represents the first combat fatalities between the Asian powers since 1975. The clash follows weeks of low-level tensions after several Indian and Chinese soldiers were injured in a high-altitude fistfight on the border at Sikkim state in early May. Within days, said Indian officials, Chinese troops encroached across the demarcation line further west in Ladakh region and India then moved in extra troops to positions opposite. Last week, both countries said they would peacefully resolve the face-off after a high-level meeting between army commanders. But on Tuesday, India revealed that those efforts had gone badly wrong, with both sides blaming each other. Beijing confirmed there had been casualties in Monday's clash but gave no further details.<br/>

But while this discussion was being carried out, Indian Army’s official statement was released on Wednesday night which stated the Indian Army had suffered 20 causalities in the clash.

			While it might sound sensible that both sides had communicated and agreed to resolve the issue “diplomatically”, it is not exactly BJP’s usual reaction to a national security challenge. Just a year earlier, in Feb 2019, when a Kashmiri local had killed 40 CRPF soldiers in Pulwama district of Indian side of Kashmir, the reaction of Indian government and media was totally opposite. Within minutes of this attack, Indian media and politicians have started to talk about Pakistan rather than the attacker. Within few hours, without any investigation the attack was attributed to be supported and funded by Pakistan. While this attack happened, KSA’s crown prince Muhammad bin Salman was on an important visit to Pakistan. PM Modi’s official statement about this attack was <em>“All tears will be avenged and the armed forces have been given full freedom to decide the place, time, intensity and nature of the retaliation against the enemy. I feel the same fire in my heart that's raging inside you”</em> while addressing to public gathering. In response Pakistan had rejected any involvement in the incident. <em>“Pakistan offers full support for any investigation in Pulwama. I guarantee action on this. It is in our interest that nobody from our soil spreads violence. I want to tell Indian government that we will take action if evidence is found against anyone from Pakistan”</em> Prime Minister Imran Khan said in an address to the nation. While across the border, Indian Media had started an all-out informational offensive against Pakistan. Indian media even aired shows where “war plans” to attack Pakistan were being discussed. Indian media talked about “Total Isolation” and “Military Revenge” against Pakistan.<br/>

				</figure><br>
			When comparing Feb, 2019 tension between India and Pakistan with current tension between India and China, there is a very interesting and common statement i.e. <h3>“We want peace between the two countries but will retaliate if our sovereignty is attacked”.</h3> Only difference is that in 2019 these were the words spoken by Prime Minister of Pakistan after Pulwama Attack to India, while in 2020 these words were spoken by Prime Minister of India to China. While Indian Media was discussing possible plans of military action against Pakistan in 2019, it was discussing economic boycott of Chinese products. These kinds of reaction clearly outline the political cashing and media management of BJP’s current government. While it is putting diplomatic solution over military action in case of China when China is claiming sovereignty over Indian area, there was no diplomatic option used in Pulwama aftermath even Pakistan’s involvement was not confirmed. In current tensions, India has been in constant communication with Chinese political and military leadership, but a year later India had zero communication with both political and military leadership of Pakistan. While sub-continent merely avoided the “Night of Murder” when India had almost launched a missile strike against Pakistan after capture of Indian pilot, there is not a single military action against China yet from Indian side. Instead, <em>“Modi punishes Xi: No ‘Happy Birthday’ this year”</em> Telegraph India reported 17 June.<em>“What Modi used to do to Imran and Oli, Xi is giving back with interest to Modi!”</em> Ashok Swain, a Professor of Peace and Conflict Research at Uppsala University, Sweden said in a tweet.<br/>

			While Pakistan had been able to strike back within 36 hours of Indian Balakot strike (while India has 5 times larger defense budget than Pakistan), India has yet to decide what to next even after 4 days of 20 causalities by China (while China has about 5 times larger defense budget than India). Pakistan’s response had been bolder and more calculated than India against a 5-times stronger enemy. So what options are left for India? Certainly not military, specially a traditional “Surgical Strike” into enemy’s territory. India has to stick to diplomatic and political channel and can not afford a military engagement against China in times when it has high tension with Pakistan and mild tensions with Nepal and Bangladesh. A front at LAC may easily lead to a front at LOC, taking in account that Services Chiefs of Pakistan have met twice with last month at ISI Headquarter to discuss “regional security issues”. There have been reports that China is demanding India to reverse its decision regarding Article-370 taken in August,2019. Although there is no official about this yet, but if there is any truth, this demand was strongly motivated by Pakistan in addition to China’s concerns on Article-370 revocation. China enjoys superior military and economic power over India which leaves India with a much lower flexibility and leverage in a negotiation. As there are no elections coming any time soon in India, so it might have to work through diplomacy and political discussion rather than Surgical Strikes.<br/>
